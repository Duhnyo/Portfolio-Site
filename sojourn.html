         <h3>What if we did this? | A Scavenger Hunt for Foodies</h3>
         <div>
            <p>
               For me, a large aspect of design is in the vision. The what-ifs and wherefores. What exists today, how can it be better, and ultimately, why and who we're designing for. Throughout this project, I was challenged to always keep these in
               clarity, as I built my understanding of the design process from start to finish.

               For our immersion course project, CareerFoundry provided us with a couple options and I found them all to be somewhat lacking in vision (Weather app, Tattoo app, Expert app, Scavenger hunt app). I took the scavenger hunt app idea and
               adapted it to focus on a problem space that I found interesting: local food discovery.

            <h4>Top Questions:</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>How can we enhance the experience of food discovery so that it's transformed from a passive activity to an active, immersive experience that elevates engagement between consumers and businesses?</li>
               <li>Can we improve and optimize the reviewing and social platforms that are currently offered in other apps?</li>
               <li>How can we encourage users to explore their locale?</li>
               <li>How can we build an experience that drives brand recognition and loyalty for local businesses?</li>
            </ul>
