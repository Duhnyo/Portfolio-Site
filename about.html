                  <h2>My Story</h2>
                  <p id="aboutme">
                     I graduated in 2018 with a B.A. in Psychology from UC Santa Barbara and broke into the world of UX by a happy accident when I discovered how frustrated I was trying to understand and learn the software of the software company
                     that I worked at.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Throughout the entire training season as I was learning the ins and outs of the software, the thought that "there must be - there needs to be something better" kept coming to me. 
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     This led me to explore the different ways that I could address these problems. So I began looking into UX Design and was instantly delighted by how it was a field that looked these issues in the eye and fought them with an
                     elegance that was concerned about the user. I was fascinated by the parallels that UX Design had with psychology and saw it as a way to combine my background in the cognitive sciences with my love for tech and design to create
                     things that would help people.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Now, I'm working on getting my UX Design Certification with CareerFoundry's bootcamp program, specializing in Front-End Web Development, and am interested in opportunities to work as a junior UX/Front-End Designer in the Santa
                     Barbara area, and my dream is to build products that bring tangible value to everyday tech users.
